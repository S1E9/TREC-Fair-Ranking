Hepatoprotective effect of the Lepidium sativum ethanolic extract (LSEE) was assessed by D-galactosamine-induced/lipopolysaccharide (400 mg/kg and 30 μg/kg) liver damage model in rats.MethodsHepatoprotective activity of LSEE (150 and 300 mg/kg) and silymarin on D-GalN/LPS induced FHF in rat was assessed using several liver function enzyme parameters. Antioxidant properties as antioxidant stress enzymes were assessed in hepatic Liver as well as mRNA expression of cytokines genes such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 and stress related genes iNOS and HO-1 were determined by RT-PCR. Protein expression of apoptotic genes were evaluated through western blot. MPO and NF-κB DNA-binding activity was analyzed by ELISA. The magnitude of hepatic impairment was investigated through histopathological evaluation.ResultsMarked amelioration of hepatic injuries by attenuation of serum and lipid peroxidation has been observed as comparable with silymarin (25 mg/kg p.o). D-GalN/LPS induced significant decrease in oxidative stress markers protein level, and albumin. LSEE significantly down-regulated the D-GalN/LPS induced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 mRNA expression in dose dependent fashion about 0.47 and 0.26 fold and up-regulates the IL-10 by 1.9 and 2.8 fold, respectively. While encourages hepatoprotective activity by down-regulating mRNA expression of iNOS and HO-1. MPO activity and NF-κB DNA-binding effect significantly increased and was mitigated by LSEE in a dose-dependent style as paralleled with silymarin.ConclusionOur data suggests that pretreatment of LSEE down regulates the caspase 3 and up-regulates the BCl2 protein expression. The above findings revealed that Lepidium sativum has significant hepatoprotective activity.","inCitations":["4d43cadb16faa81242a376119098b3ee03b2ed29","bf10386d6a5118d956596981334fa896004ceea9","a9913fe2c79f87987a74ef21ef50e3303d20e688","548e44569874e182508750ce3f633003b04934db","c77b9e4b90e10f24a5c6a28cf4fa4bd1d471bb47","df99ba14d529e2bb0e3b9e3246659fe86d75eaf3","c7db81c9ea769aa2850b2c39f65c3c1e26d1a191","f74dbad20431ef50689411fd0a9bfd204d94d68b","612efef1bac4c975c3b8d577540c1b83974a19a7","68ee69cb00da10a6d4a24f77250e41c3aa460d65","12b32c1ae14ef00fb1c2aaf37bc4e53e8502407a","164c1b910294ee2e3a4eaa9423ee34128fe19f78","4cc6a6d744783bfb685ec0c2175a57a10665be19","106ea4335c8287f87544770d24bfa17e91592e44","3c1775c7fad8382b2a98b7ad38135fa01fb38c73","acf81e468539bfc973101be7fd40ca87fe929336"],"pdfUrls":["https://bmccomplementalternmed.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12906-016-1483-4"],"title":"Hepatoprotective activity of Lepidium sativum seeds against D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide induced hepatotoxicity in animal model","doi":"10.1186/s12906-016-1483-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-016-1483-4","venue":"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine"}

This study examined the possible Flynn effects on clinical memory tests involving the learning and recall of verbal and nonverbal material. Comparisons of the age-related norms on the list learning and design learning tasks from the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (AMIPB), published in 1985, and its successor, the BIRT (Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust) Memory and Information Processing Battery (BMIPB) published in 2007, indicate that there is a significant Flynn effect on tests of memory function. This effect appears to be material specific with statistically significant improvements in all scores on tests involving the learning and recall of visual material in every age range evident over a 22-year period. Verbal memory abilities appear to be relatively stable with no significant differences between the scores in the majority of age ranges. The ramifications for the clinical interpretation of these tests are discussed.","inCitations":["c0fff35a62b68ce8c4cacc42a87ec99312540599","f0d35037a9f909709e98dc91969c7790a34d7e86","fec66a350496684fb8b379d0a718245161577587","08fc7aa83f1910f600e8681776cf04a1a9ff87c0","af2b1d4b47b0911bec8efbbc9cfc64c5cc1c99aa","38401e7d8dfe1966af66669f5045a5add562fca5","d5f3249d0f15cffd04667427ed3fe4323d2da99d","c67b8a251ffecba5c61a0ce6d4f5e69cb3e79c49","50ffe4172106789824c59fe7d727f822cb8b1408","eb40ed5effa7aa9b645ba5360f144d1d470b11e9","e7db021389bfc158036b08ecf562e0735d48db7b","b17a5fdbd1f20e17a6e08f34c8b5cebcc50cfb19","3d394276fc88ff6b99884d8ab65788bcd6ab7121","e158cea57fefe15da53260537002cfa540878d59","cdd5d940b4e2a298a264246c4225d6a1238e8ab5","8ddd5897dfc6b030f7e2d8b6cba7da605eec1cd0","07fca32b4dbe5e1abe46409267c149d2bd192c26","3451129af1454a74d94c40f7c323ef73c520d9e7","5abe8e13ebe987ed12de98ee84683de4a2600bdc","ae15575bdeacb6b58d1cdb33fd9916a6ff0ee486","ffd588b2bc0125c53380b0189e5c0bd6bed960ea","63855666c4b7fe0133df2960d0365bd30009adca","dba44f096c42cbada1ee33d66bd1be2265e6cb82"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/baxendale2010.pdf"],"title":"The Flynn effect and memory function","doi":"10.1080/13803390903493515","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13803390903493515","venue":"Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology"}
